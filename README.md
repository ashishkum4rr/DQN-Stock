DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ON ADANIPORTS STOCK DATA

This project delves into the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for stock data analysis, showcasing its potential to revolutionize financial trading. DRL algorithms empower investors to unearth hidden patterns within market data, predict future trends, and refine trading strategies. This exploration investigates the intricacies of DRL and its impact on the stock market, offering a glimpse into the future of finance. The project is accompanied by code snippets and insightful charts to illuminate the concepts.

PROJECT SCOPE
This implementation focuses on three DRL algorithms:

Deep Q Network (DQN)
Double Deep Q Network (DDQN)
Dueling Double Deep Q Network (Dueling DDQN)

These algorithms are trained on a fixed dataset encompassing ADANIPORTS stock data. The results, particularly with DDQN, demonstrate promising outcomes in predicting market behavior within a broader range.
