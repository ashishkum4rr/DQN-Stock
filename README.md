DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ON ADANIPORTS STOCK DATA

This project examines DRLâ€™s application to stock data analysis, demonstrating its transformative potential for financial trading. With DRL algorithms, investors can decipher hidden patterns, forecast market trends, and enhance trading strategies. Explore the intricacies of DRL and how it affects the stock market as we explore the future of finance accompanied by code snippets and charts.

This project implements Deep Q Network, Double Deep Q Network and Dueling Double Deep q Network over a fixed datasetof ADANIPORTS. However, we can find the DDQN predictions to be more precise over a wide variety of range.



PROJECT SCOPE

This implementation focuses on three DRL algorithms:

Deep Q Network (DQN),
Double Deep Q Network (DDQN),
Dueling Double Deep Q Network (Dueling DDQN)


These algorithms are trained on a fixed dataset encompassing ADANIPORTS stock data. The results, particularly with DDQN, demonstrate promising outcomes in predicting market behavior within a broader range.
